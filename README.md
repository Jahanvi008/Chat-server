### Project Information
The following project is a web chat server built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript for front end and Java, HTTP request, and WebSockets in the back end that has the ability to make multiple rooms in real-time. You can join an existing room with a unique code for each room or create a new one. Once inside a chatroom, only the room members can chat and view your messages in real-time.

### Improvements
The main improvement made to the interaction functionalities was the user had to enter their username prior to joining a chatroom. A validation feature was also added so an alert will appear if a username isn't given.

Style changes were made to the interface primarily using Bootstrap. The chat server was given a grey and blue color scheme and the font Merriweather was used throughout. Avatar pictures when people chat were also added.


### How-To-Run
To run this program, first download the files off of GitHub using git clone.
Open the project folder in the IDE of your choice (VSCode, IntelliJ, etc.). Run the index.html file. Enter your username when prompted. From here, the create and join room button will be visible. Click on it to join an existing chat room or create a new one. You can type your message in the message box or leave the room. 

If you encounter any problems running the chat server, try running the index.html file in a different browser.
